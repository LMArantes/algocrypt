# AlgoCrypt: Online Encryption & Decryption Tool

AlgoCrypt is an interactive web-based application designed to help users encrypt and decrypt text using a variety of cryptographic algorithms. The goal of this project is to provide a hands-on experience with historical and modern encryption techniques while allowing users to understand how these ciphers work.

## Installation

### Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the Application
Run the Streamlit app with the following command:
```bash
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```

<br>

## Accessing the Application
AlgoCrypt can be accessed online at: [Koyeb | AlgoCrypt](https://algocrypt.koyeb.app/)

<br>

## Status: Work in Progress üöß

AlgoCrypt is currently in its early development stage, and none of the encryption or decryption features have been implemented yet.
The project structure is in place, and work is ongoing to build the encoding and decoding tools for each cipher.

## Contribution

We welcome contributions! Since the project is still in development, here are a few ways you can help:
- Implement encryption and decryption functions for different ciphers.
- Improve the UI and user experience.
- Write documentation and explanations for each cipher.
- Report issues or suggest features.
